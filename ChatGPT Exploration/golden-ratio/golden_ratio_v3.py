  Building off the last chat from golden_ratio_v2.py

  Q: Could you please use a curve, instead of a sequence of lines, to draw the golden ratio? 
  The result should be a spiral, curved, not straight.

  A: Certainly! Here is a program that draws a golden ratio spiral using curves instead of a
  sequence of lines:

    **code is given**

  This program draws a spiral by using the turtle.circle() function to draw a curve with a
  radius equal to the length of the current segment, and turning left by an angle that is
  determined by the golden ratio (Ï†) at each iteration. The spiral will be drawn in a golden
  color, using a turtle with a pen size of 1 pixel.

  I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

  Interestingly, the window popup was showing halfway out or my screen (above).
  I tried to let ChatGPT deal with it.

  Q: The window popup seems to appear halfway above my screen. Could you fix that for me?

  A: Certainly! Here is a modified version of the program that positions the window at the center of the screen:

    **code is given**

  This program uses the turtle.window_width() and turtle.window_height() functions to get the width
  and height of the screen, and the turtle.getcanvas().winfo_toplevel() function to get the root window
  that contains the turtle canvas. The root.geometry() function is then used to position the window at
  the center of the screen.

  I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

  The display was still out of bounds, only at the top left, not the top center.
  Let's try again.

  Q: The screen is popping up at the top left corner now, not the center. Could you fix this for me?

  A: Certainly! It looks like there is a problem with the calculation of the screen width and height.
  Here is a modified version of the program that correctly calculates the screen width and height:

    **code is given**

  This program correctly calculates the screen width and height using the turtle.window_width()
  and turtle.window_height() functions, which return the width and height of the screen in pixels.
  The window is then positioned at the center of the screen using the root.geometry() function.

  I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

  Still not quite there. I want a natural viewing window, not smack dab at the corner of the screen.

  Q: Could you adjust the screen down a tad?

  A: Certainly! Here is a modified version of the program that positions the window slightly lower
  on the screen:

    **code is given**

  This program positions the window 100 pixels lower on the screen by modifying the value passed
  to the root.geometry() function.

  Oops! ChatGPT made a mistake! Subtracting 100 puts the screen further up, not down.
  Let's correct it.

  Q: It appears that subtracting 100 pushed the screen further up, not down. Could you fix this?

  A: Certainly! It looks like there was a mistake in the calculation of the y-coordinate for the

  We got the dimensions working (kind of), but the drawing isn't quite what I was looking for.
