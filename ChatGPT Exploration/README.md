## Testing a variety of code generated by [Open AI's ChatGPT.](https://chat.openai.com/chat)

#### According to ChatGPT itself:

    Q: What is ChatGPT, and can it generate code?
    
    ---  
    
    A: ChatGPT is a variant of the GPT (Generative Pre-training Transformer) language model that has  
    been specifically designed for chatbot applications. It was developed by OpenAI and released in 2020.

    Like other GPT models, ChatGPT is a machine learning model that uses a combination of deep learning  
    and natural language processing techniques to generate human-like text. It is trained on a large  
    dataset of text and can generate coherent and varied responses to a wide range of input prompts.

    As for generating code, ChatGPT is not designed for that purpose. It is a language model that is  
    focused on generating natural language text and is not specifically trained or equipped to generate  
    code. While it is possible that ChatGPT could potentially generate code-like text if given a suitable  
    prompt, it would not have the ability to understand the meaning or function of the code it generates  
    or to write code that is syntactically or semantically correct.
